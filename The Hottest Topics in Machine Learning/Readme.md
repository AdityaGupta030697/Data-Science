Using Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.

# Project Description

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. 
In this Project, Large collection of NIPS research papers are analyzed from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. 
The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.
