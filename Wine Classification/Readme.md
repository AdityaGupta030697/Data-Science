## Project Description

It is a very famous multi-class classification problem. This data is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy using three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The dataset comprises 13 features ('alcohol', 'malic_acid', 'ash', 'alcalinity_of_ash', 'magnesium', 'total_phenols', 'flavanoids', 'nonflavanoid_phenols', 'proanthocyanins', 'color_intensity', 'hue', 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines', 'proline') and a target (type of cultivars).

This data has three types of cultivar classes: 'class_0', 'class_1', and 'class_2'. Here,we can build a model to classify the type of cultivar.
