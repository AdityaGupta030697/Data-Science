Load, transform, and understand images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.

# Project Description

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, Python image library Pillow is used to load and manipulate image data along with common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline .
